                        <p style="font-size:24px">I believe that what makes humans unique is our ability to change the world - through our skills, passions and drive, we proactively shape the world into a better one for those who follow. Throughout my years, I have endeavoured to equip myself with the skills necessary to make a change. I am passionate in engineering and programming, having partaken in numerous local and international competitions such as First Lego League (FLL), and RoboRave Australia, deepening my knowledge in the STEM field. I regularly practice empathy and leadership during my years as a Peer Support Leader and Class Chairperson at school. I let my discipline and critical thinking shine through being a constant top scorer in my school, having clinched the Best in history award twice in my secondary years. Most importantly, I am never satisfied with "good enough", for I always strive to become a better version of myself every day. No matter what challenges I face ahead, through the fire and the flames will I emerge triumphant.</p>

                            <p>My team and I were especially eager for this competition, being our last one in the CCA. During the competition, I adapted to and overcame many unforseen challenges, such as the malfunctioning of certain functions of the robot and difficult alliance partners. We fostered strong connections within the VEX community, supporting both allies and competitors. Our positive attitude managed to earn us the "Inspire Award," recognizing our spirit throughout the event! </p>
