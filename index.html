                        <p style="font-size:24px">I believe that what makes humans unique is our ability to change the world - through our skills, passions and drive, we proactively shape the world into a better one for those who follow. Throughout my years, I have endeavoured to equip myself with the skills necessary to make a change. I am passionate in engineering and programming, having partaken in numerous local and international competitions such as First Lego League (FLL), and RoboRave Australia, deepening my knowledge in the STEM field. I regularly practice empathy and leadership during my years as a Peer Support Leader and Class Chairperson at school. I let my discipline and critical thinking shine through being a constant top scorer in my school, having clinched the Best in history award twice in my secondary years. Most importantly, I am never satisfied with "good enough", for I always strive to become a better version of myself every day. No matter what challenges I face ahead, through the fire and the flames will I emerge triumphant.</p>

                            <p>In the SEGC competition, we were challenged to envision daily life in Singapore in 2050 — with a focus on how energy would be sustainably generated and used. Using Minecraft as our creative platform, we built a detailed model of our future city, blending innovation with environmental responsibility. Through this project, we deepened our understanding of clean energy, climate awareness, and sustainable urban living — and were proud to achieve 3rd place in the competition.</p>

                            <p>Developed Parents Guardpost in collaboration with CyberYouth Singapore and SUTD — a website that links children's social media accounts to their parents' to detect and flag potentially predatory behaviour. This was my first experience with HTML and CSS, where I led the programming team while specialising in the front-end department, collaborated with students from other institutions, and learned web development through hands-on problem solving. We were awarded the Trailblazing Solution Award in Stage I of STEAMunity and enhanced the project further in Stage II.</p>

                            <p>Co-developed Dyslexhelp, a project designed to support individuals with dyslexia by identifying dyslexic handwriting and providing targeted practice exercises to improve it over time. I led the front-end development, but I also gained exposure to working with APIs, machine learning concepts, and real-world datasets which deepened my understanding of how technology can be used to create inclusive, impactful solutions.</p>
